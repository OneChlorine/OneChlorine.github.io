        <h1>(Once upon a time, there were two person: GG Bond and Phoebe Hwa. They were the couple.)</h1>
        <p>It seems that they were the couple naturally and the "fact" was accepted by the public. "NO PDA" is invaild for G and P. For them, locking lips each other and PDA are usual. Super Q, Bobby and Sdaddy also eat the "dogfood" every once in a while. Even someone think that the couple have made a love. (Oh My God)</p>
